			</p>

			<div class="f">

			<p class="g">
				Gaming has remained one of the most profitable industries since last six decades. The current generation is enjoying playing video games on devices with lightning fast processing and the graphics quality is also incredibly crystal clear and more realistic. Our grandparents never had this luxury when they used to play video games. From games with boring black and white graphics being played by one gamer on one device to cloud based multiplayer games seducing gamers of all ages from all over the world, we can say that more than two generations have witnessed this unbelievable evolution of the gaming industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, cyber game tournaments are being organized and there are professional gamers participating in these tournaments. A decade ago, the prize money at the World Cyber Games 2008 was $470,000. 800 gamers from 78 countries participated in the tournament. Age of Empire, Asphalt, Counter Strike, FIFA, Need For Speed and StarCraft, we all play these games at home. These are some of the games gamers played in the tournament. Today, these tournaments are streamed live and millions of individuals watch these games online.
			</p>
			<p>
				Though the processing speed and internal memories of Smartphone impedes a great gaming experience, still companies are investing in mobile games as this is the most used device. Moreover, the Smartphones of the current and next generation will have sufficient internal memories and processing powers to play games with the best graphics and features. Though professional gamers who are making money by playing use high-end devices, still the number of individuals playing games on mobile phones is huge. It is an opportunity with an exceptional return on investment. So, mobile gaming is also the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the question remains unanswered. How Is Blockchain technology going to change the way online gaming and eSports industry will work? Well, the question will remain unanswered unless we look into the current challenges that are acting as barriers to the growth of the industry.
			</p>
			<h1>Following are the issues we can address using Blockchain technology:</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Lack of One Common Platform for All Games and Services</li>
					<li>Lack of Interaction between Gamers and Operators</li>
					<li>Inefficient and Unregulated revenue an Reward Network</li>
					<li>Privacy and Safety Concerns Due To Fraud</li>
				</ul>
			<h1>
				What Is The Benefit Of Operating All Games And Services Through One Common Platform?
			</h1>
			<p>
				With data being siloed to individual companies, it is not possible for one service to learn about the good or bad reputation of a gamer working with some other service. If data of one service is made available to another service, this will help in preventing issues such as fraud and also addressing privacy and safety concerns. And, data can be analyzed and used intelligently. This also helps in enhancing the online gambling and gaming experience. Making all games and services available at common platform allows gamers and operators to draw more revenue opportunities.
			</p>
			<h1>What is in BigBang Ecosystem for Operators and Gamers?</h1>
			<p>BigBang Ecosystem is being developed to take care of the interests of all actors.</p>
